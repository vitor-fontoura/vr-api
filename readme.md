# VR API

This project I will use as my final paper for the university, along with a front-end project and a three.js project.

The project itself consists of a customizable virtual environment, using virtual reality, to emerge students in pre-elaborated exercises during classes. These exercises must be previously created by the teachers.

## Overview

This API must be able to authenticate users, allow them to create different environments, including scenarios, objects that may be in those scenarios, and actions that can be performed on those objects.

The API must be connected to an interface where teachers can customize environments

The API should also be linked to a three.js application that will be used by the students during class with the support of their teachers.

## Objectives
- Bringing new technologies into the basic education classrooms
- Making the learning process more interesting for children
- Provide free software that can be used by teachers in elementary schools
- Allow disabled students to participate in this experiment

## Used tecnologies
This API project uses the Laravel Lumen framework.
